This repository contains placeholder Laravel structures for future development.

## Modules

The following service classes, models, migrations, and basic routes are included as starting points:

- **Volunteer**: `app/Models/Volunteer.php`, `app/Services/VolunteerService.php`, migration in `database/migrations`, and route in `routes/api.php`.
- **Vehicle**: `app/Models/Vehicle.php`, `app/Services/VehicleService.php`, migration in `database/migrations`, and route in `routes/api.php`.
- **Checklist**: `app/Models/Checklist.php`, `app/Services/ChecklistService.php`, migration in `database/migrations`, and route in `routes/api.php`.

These files act as scaffolding for future business logic and database schema design.
